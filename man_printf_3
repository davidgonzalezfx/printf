			Linux Manual PRINTF(3)					

DESCRIPTION PRINTF
	    In _printf project we code from zero our own custom printf function.
	    Native printf function allows you to print with certain formats. 
	    We handle most basic format so you can print chars, strings, 
	    positive and negative numbers, hex, octa and binary numbers among
	    other formats. You can see man 3 of printf to understand how printf works.

DESCRIPTION ONE BY ONE

	    PRINTF - format and print all data.
	    The character % is followed by zero or more of the following flags:

	    c	Print char values. the int argument is converted to an unsigned char
	    	and the resulting character is written.

	    s	Print strings. The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer
	    	to an array of character type (pointer to a string).

	    d	Print numbers. i has the same functionality.

	    b	Print nums converted to binary.

	    u	Print nums as unsigned int.

	    o	Print nums converted to octal.

	    x	Print nums converted to hexadecimal.

	    X	Print hexadecimal mayus

	    p	Print pointer address or any other variable

	rot13	Print the alphabet more 13 more fields

	    %%	Print % character.

	    

EXAMPLES

	 int main (void)
	 {
	 printf ("char %c", char);
    	 printf ("string  %s", string);
	 printf ("%d", int);
	 printf ("%b", binary);
	 printf ("%u", unsigned int);
	 printf ("%o", octal);
	 printf ("%x", hexadecimal);
	 }
